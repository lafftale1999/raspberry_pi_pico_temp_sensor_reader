1. Generate our own certificate authority certificate and key
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -extensions v3_ca -keyout my_ca.key -out my_ca.crt

- Enter PEM passphrase (used for accessing the private key)
- Enter a bunch of other fields.

2. Generate a private key for our MQTT broker
$ openssl genrsa -out broker.key 2048

3. Generate a signing request to send to the CA to sign the brokers cert
$ openssl req -out broker.csr -key broker.key -new

- Enter some information regarding the cert.
- Common Name = server FQDN or your name

4. Send the CSR to the CA (in this case our own CA) and they will sign the cert.
$ openssl x509 -req -in broker.csr -CA my_ca.crt -CAkey my_ca.key -CAcreateserial -out broker.crt -days 180

- Enter the PEM pass for the temp_mqtt_broker_ca.key

5. The certificates are now generated. Add the to the correct files in your Project (remember to add the file or directory to .gitignore).

6. Add the files in your .config_file
